  <p>Julia Package implementing Decision Trees and Random Forests for Machine Learning.</p>

## Brief Explanation

[Decision Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) are a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. They split the data into subsets based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents a predicted outcome.

[Random Forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) improve on Decision Trees by creating an ensemble of multiple decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data. The final prediction is made by averaging the outputs of all trees (for regression) or using a majority vote (for classification), which helps reduce overfitting and improves model accuracy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Version | Installation Guide | Required |
|--------------|---------|--------------------|----------|
| Julia       | 1.10    | [![Julia](https://img.shields.io/badge/Julia-v1.10-blue)](https://julialang.org/downloads/) | ‚úÖ |


## üöÄ Getting Started

1. ‚ú® **Downloading the Code**

    To get started, download the code using one of the following links:

  - **Normal HTTPS Link:**

      ``` bash
      git clone https://github.com/nichtJakob/OneTwoTree.jl.git
      ```


  - **SSH Link:**

      ``` bash
      git clone git@github.com:nichtJakob/OneTwoTree.jl.git
      ```


2. üîß **Installation and Dependency Setup**

    Run the following commands in the package's root directory to install the dependencies and activate the package's virtual environment:

  - For Contributors:

      ```bash
      julia --project
      ```
    It might be necessary to resolve dependencies.
    Go into the package manager by pressing `]`. Then type
      ```julia
      resolve
      ```


3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Example: Running a Simple Example**

    ### Classification
    ```julia
    using OneTwoTree

    # The rows are the different data points
    dataset = [
      3.5 9.1 2.9
      1.0 1.2 0.4
      5.6 3.3 4.3
    ]
    labels = ["A", "B", "C"]

    tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2)
    fit!(tree, dataset, labels)
    print(tree)

    prediction = predict(tree, [
      2.0 4.0 6.0
    ])
    print("The tree predicted class $(prediction[1]).")
    ```
    - Note that the classifier currently only supports training datasets of type `Real` and labels of type `String`
    - Note that that the Tree Construction in its current state can be very slow. Therefore, it may be advised to use small training datasets for the moment.

    ### Regression
    ```julia
    using OneTwoTree
    dataset = [
      1.0 2.0
      2.0 3.0
      3.0 4.0
      4.0 5.0
    ]
    labels = [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5]
    
    tree = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3)
    fit!(tree, dataset, labels)
    print(tree)

    prediction = predict(tree, [
      1.0 4.0
    ])
    print("The tree predicted $(prediction[1]).")
    ```
   ### Loading Datasets
   You can find a more extensive example which utilises the `Iris` dataset from `MLDatasets` in `demo_iris.jl`. :)
